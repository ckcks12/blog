# Result

|Language|Compile|Execution|File Size|JVM Required|
|:-|-:|-:|-:|:-:|
|Go|0.11s|0.55s|1.1M|X|
|Java(by kotlinc)|5.51s|1.15s|691B|O|
|Kotlin Native|12.46s|2.85s|912K|X|


# Source
### main.go
```go
package main

func main() {
   s := 0
   for i := 0; i < 2147483647; i++ {
       s += i
       s -= i
   }
   println(s)
}
```
### main.kt
```kotlin
fun main() {
   var s = 0
   for (i in 0..2147483646) {
       s += i
       s -= i
   }
   println(s)
}
```

# Build
```bash
# go
go build main.go

# java by kotlinc
kotlinc main.kt

# kotlin native
kotlinc-native main.kt
```

# Why? Why is Kotlin *super* slower than others?
Well, I don't know ðŸ˜… How do I know that?

Kotlin Native requires XCode CLI. Also compiler downloads a lot of dependencies the first time it runs. 

Instead, Go generates its own binary (with using gcc and stuff).

Maybe, that's the key I guess ðŸ¤¨
